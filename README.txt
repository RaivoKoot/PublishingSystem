Contains the initial database interface as a structure and the basic model classes

Within the src (source) folder the folder:

- database_interface contains the interface which is what youll want to look at most
- models contains the data classes
- exceptions contains some custom exceptions which you don't really need to look at much for now
- and main_test contains a main method that you can run that gives a little console demonstration of instantiating some dummy objects
